CREATOR OF THE FIRST COMPUTER WORM TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE INTERNET, MORRIS, A STUDENT AT CORNELL UNIVERISTY
IN THE USA, CLAIMED IT HIS PROGENY WAS NOT AIMED TO HARM BUT WAS MADE FOR THE INNOCUOUS INTENT TO DETERMINE THE
VASTNESS OF THE CYBERSPACE. THINGS WENT PEAR-SHAPED WHEN A THE WORM ENCOUNTERED A CRITICAL ERROR AND MORPHED
INTO A VIRUS WHICH REPLICATED RAPIDLY AND BEGAN INFECTING OTHER COMPUTERS RESULTING IN DENIAL OF SERVICE.
THE DAMAGE? 6000 COMPUTERS WERE REPORTEDLY AFFECTED CAUSING AN ESTIMATED $10-$100 MILLION DOLLARS IN REPAIR BILLS.
ROBERT TAPPAN MORRIS AND THE MORRIS WORM (1988): WHILE THIS EVENT COULD BE PINNED AS BEING AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT,
IT NO DOUBT PLAYED A PART IN INSPIRING THE CALAMITOUS DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DDOS) TYPE OF ATTACKS WE SEE TODAY.

MICHAEL CALCE A.K.A. MAFIABOY. IN 2000, CALCE, NOW 25, WAS JUST A CANADIAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHEN DECIDED TO
UNLEASH A DDOS ATTACK ON A NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILE COMMERCIAL WEBSITES INCLUDING AMAZON, CNN, EBAY AND YAHOO!.
AN INDUSTRY EXPERT ESTIMATED THE ATTACKS RESULTED IN A $US1.2 BILLION DOLLAR DAMAGE BILL. HE WAS LATER APPREHENDED.
BECAUSE HE WAS STILL A JUVENILE, CALCE WAS SENTENCED IN 2001 TO EIGHT MONTHS IN OPEN CUSTODY, MEANING HIS MOVEMENTS
AND ACTIONS WOULD BE RESTRICTED. HIS ONLINE ACCESS WAS ALSO LIMITED BY THE COURT. CALCE AND SINCE SCORED GIGS AS
A COLUMNIST AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED A BOOK ABOUT HIS ORDEAL.
