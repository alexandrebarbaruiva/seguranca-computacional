WIRELESS ATTACKS HAVE BECOME A VERY COMMON SECURITY ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO NETWORKS.
THIS IS BECAUSE SUCH ATTACKS CAN REALLY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT IS BEING SENT
ACROSS A NETWORK AND USE IT TO COMMIT SOME CRIMES IN OTHER NETWORKS. EVERY WIRELESS
NETWORK IS VERY VULNERABLE TO SUCH KINDS OF ATTACKS AND IT IS THEREFORE VERY IMPORTANT
THAT ALL THE NECESSARY SECURITY MEASURES ARE TAKEN SO AS TO PREVENT THE MESS THAT CAN
BE CAUSED BY SUCH ATTACKS. THESE ATTACKS ARE NORMALLY CARRIED OUT TO TARGET INFORMATION
THAT IS BEING SHARED THROUGH THE NETWORKS. IT IS THEREFORE VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW OF
SUCH ATTACKS SO THAT ONE IS IN A POSITION TO IDENTIFY IT IN CASE IT HAPPENS. SOME OF
THE COMMON NETWORK ATTACKS HAVE BEEN OUTLINED BELOW.

A ROGUE ACCESS POINT IS BASICALLY AN ACCESS POINT THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO ONE'S NETWORK
WITHOUT ONE'S KNOWLEDGE. ONE TOTALLY HAS NO IDEA THAT IT IS THERE. THIS IS A KIND OF
SCENARIO THAT CAN CREATE A KIND OF BACK DOOR ESPECIALLY IF ONE IS NOT CONVERSANT WITH
IT AND HAVE COMPLETE MANAGEMENT OF IT. THIS IS AN ACCESS POINT THAT CAN CREATE SOME
VERY HUGE SECURITY CONCERNS.
ONE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE VERY EASY TO PLUG IN A WIRELESS ACCESS POINT
IN IT. IF ONE IS NOT DOING ANY TYPE OF NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL PROTOCOLS ON ONE'S
NETWORK, IT BECOMES VERY EASY FOR ADDITIONAL WORKSTATIONS AND ACCESS POINTS TO BE
ADDED ONTO ONE'S NETWORK.
THIS CAN BE COMBATED BY HAVING SOME NETWORK ACCESS CONTROLS IN PLACE OR OCCASIONALLY
HAVE SOME WALKS AROUND ONE'S BUILDING AND SEE IF ONE CAN COME ACROSS ACCESS POINTS
THAT ONE HAVE NO IDEA OF. ONE CAN USE SOME SPECIAL TOOLS THAT ONE CAN OBTAIN FROM
THE INTERNET THAT WILL ENABLE ONE TO SEE ALL THAT IS HAPPENING IN ONE'S WIRELESS
NETWORK.
ONE MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER USING THE 802.1X NETWORK CONTROL ACCESS SO THAT PEOPLE
AUTHENTICATE TO THE NETWORK EVERY TIME THEY PLUG IN A DEVICE EITHER IN A WIRELESS
OR WIRED NETWORK. THIS WILL NOT NECESSARILY PREVENT PEOPLE FROM PLUGGING IN AN
ACCESS POINT BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THE PEOPLE CONNECTING TO THAT ACCESS POINT
AUTHENTICATE THROUGH THE METHODS ONE HAVE SET IN PLACE.
